        <h1 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">The Problem</h1> 
        <p class="centertext" >Clothesline was born from a desire to tackle the fashion challenges many college students face. Oftentimes, the number of different outings and events an average student attends far outweighs the diversity in clothes they own. Alongside tight budgets, this imbalance frequently leads to unsustainable spending on fast fashion—buying clothes for a single event and then discarding them. Our goal is to provide a solutions that is more budget-friendly, space-efficient, and environmentally conscious.</p>
        <p class="centertext" >With Clothesline, students can borrow and lend clothing items to each other for a fraction of the retail price. For instance, if someone has a formal or themed party to attend but are missing the key piece, they can use Clothesline to connect with a person willing to lend that item out.</p>

        <h1 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">User Interviews</h1> 
        <p class="centertext" >During user interviews, we paid the most attention to <b>1)</b> If/How users have encoutered the problem in the past <b>2)</b> What process users are most familiar with in a borrowing/lending exchange and <b>3)</b> How much effort they are willing to put into said process. While most said that they were interested and would likely use an app like Clothesline, a common concern that arose was whether or not we could ensure that other users would reliable. Because we (the developers) lack the proper means to fully enforce our community guidelines, we needed to come up with certain futures to establish as much trust as possible.</p>

        <h1 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">Key Takeaways</h1> 
        <h2 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">Search/Browse</h2> 
        <p class="centertext" >Clothesline is all about providing users with the clothes they need, when they need it. Through the search feature, users can easily find the exact pieces they are looking for. Our browsing page allows additional flexibility for users to explore their choices.</p>
        <h2 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">Profile</h2> 
        <p class="centertext" >We wanted to emphasize personal style exploration and social engagement. With a Profile feature, lenders can create public closets and build trust by matching listings to familiar faces.</p>
        <h2 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">Messaging</h2> 
        <p class="centertext" >Credibility was a large concern, for both borrowers and lenders. In-App messaging was created so that users would feel comfortable knowing who they are interacting with, before meeting. Because Clothesline is restricted to college campuses, users will likely be able to vet others through mutual peers or activity on the app.</p>
        <h2 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">Saved/Liked</h2> 
        <p class="centertext" >We also wanted to ensure that browsing on the app wouldn’t be strenuous. To prevent eventual scrolling fatigue, users would be able to save items they like and come back to them later.</p>

        <h1 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">Troubleshooting & Next Steps</h1> 
        <p class="centertext" >While we were able to partially address the trust issues users faced when interacting with others through the app—thanks to features like the review system, UCLA student verification, and the verified renters section—we still have concerns about potential drop-offs during borrower-lender transactions. One solution we plan to implement in the future is a “Rent Contract” accessible through the messaging page. This feature will allow users to easily fill out a preset form detailing essential information such as meeting time, location, and duration of the loan. Eventually, we hope to incorporate legal processes to further strengthen the system, but we believe that even without this, the contract feature will encourage greater user accountability.</p>
        <p class="centertext" >Due to the constraints of the 10-week school quarter, we were unable to fully deploy the app with all the desired features. However, work on Clothesline will resume shortly this fall. As a UX/UI Designer on the team, my primary goals will be to enhance accessibility within the app and ensure that the core processes are intuitive, especially for users who may not be familiar with renting and borrowing applications. Additionally, I will focus on maintaining consistent and engaging branding/aesthetics to help establish a strong user base and a lasting presence at our school for years to come.</p>
