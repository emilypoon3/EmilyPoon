        <h1 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">The Problem</h1> 
        <p class="centertext" >Clothesline was born from a desire to tackle the fashion challenges many college students face. Oftentimes, the number of different outings and events an average student attends far outweighs the diversity in clothes they own. Alongside tight budgets, this imbalance frequently leads to unsustainable spending on fast fashion—buying clothes for a single event and then discarding them. Our goal is to provide a solutions that is more budget-friendly, space-efficient, and environmentally conscious.</p>
        <p class="centertext" >With Clothesline, students can borrow and lend clothing items to each other for a fraction of the retail price. For instance, if someone has a formal or themed party to attend but are missing the key piece, they can use Clothesline to connect with a person willing to lend that item out.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="rightheadtwo" style="padding-top: 5px;">User Interviews</h1> 
        <p class="centertext" >During user interviews, we paid the most attention to <b>1)</b> If/How users have encoutered the problem in the past 2. What process users are most familiar with in a borrowing/lending exchange and 3. How much effort they are willing to put into said process. While most said that they were interested and would likely use an app like Clothesline, a common concern that arose was whether or not we could ensure that other users would reliable. Because we (the developers) lack the proper means to fully enforce our community guidelines, we needed to come up with certain futures to establish as much trust as possible.</p>
