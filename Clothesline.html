        <p class="centertext" >Clothesline was born from a desire to tackle the fashion challenges many college students face. Oftentimes, the number of different outings and events an average student attends far outweighs the diversity in clothes they own. Alongside tight budgets, this imbalance frequently leads to unsustainable spending on fast fashionâ€”buying clothes for a single event and then discarding them. Our goal is to provide a solutions that is more budget-friendly, space-efficient, and environmentally conscious.</p>
